## Is the company doing good or bad?

There are a few question we have when we are investing in a company
- Can the business survive?
- Is it growing?
- Is it profitable?
- Is it financially healthy?

These 3 statements together help us do that
- They help stakholders (like investors, creditors, regulators) assess the financial health and performance of the business.
- Ultimately they provide data for decision-making (investing, lending, etc.)

|Statement       |Question it tries to answer |
|----------------|----------------------------|
|Balance Sheet   |How strong is the company financialy? Does it balance good between its assets/liabilites/equities|
|Income Statement|Is the company making money? Is the business profitable and is it making money over time|
|Cash Flow       |Can the company meet its short term obligations (cash movements)|


## Another way to look at these statements
- Balance Sheet -> What resources the company controls, and how they are financed
- Income Statement -> How well the company generates profit from its operations.
- Cash Flow -> Where cash is generated and spent - used for liquidity assessment.
